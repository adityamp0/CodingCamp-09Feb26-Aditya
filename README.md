A premium, minimalist, and responsive portfolio website built with HTML5, CSS3, and Vanilla JavaScript. This project features a clean "Emerald Green" aesthetic with smooth scroll animations, glassmorphism effects, and a fully functional contact form.

## Key Features

- **Minimalist Design**: Premium aesthetics using a curated color palette (`#07b36d` Emerald Green) and modern typography (Outfit & Inter).
- **Personalized Welcoming Speech**: A premium glassmorphism modal that greets visitors and dynamically updates the hero section with a time-based personalized message.
- **Fully Responsive**: Optimized for desktop, tablet, and mobile devices with a custom hamburger menu.
- **Scroll Reveal Animations**: Dynamic content loading as you scroll using the `IntersectionObserver` API for a smooth user experience.
- **Interactive Navbar**: Transparent glassmorphism header that shrinks and adjusts opacity during scroll for better focus.
- **Form Validation**: Advanced client-side validation for the contact form with clean error states and immediate feedback.
- **Multi-page Architecture**: Independent modules for Home, Profile, Portfolio, and Services for better information hierarchy.
